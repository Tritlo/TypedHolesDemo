-- Consider the following module
module Main where

-- We import everyones favorite library
import Control.Lens

-- We import this for nicer output, since it's use internally in Lens.
import Control.Monad.State


-- And we declare a very simple data type
newtype Test = Test { _value :: Integer } deriving (Show)

-- We declare a lens to be able to operate on that data type
value :: Lens' Test Integer
value f (Test i) = Test <$> f i

-- But, we want to try the newfangled do-notation syntax we've heard so
-- much about!

-- Let's try it!
updTest :: Test -> Test
updTest t = t &~ do
    _a value (+1)  -- First version
    _b value 1   -- Second version

-- I don't know lens well enough to show more cool examples. Time to learn,
-- I guess

emptyTest :: Test
emptyTest = Test 0

main :: IO ()
